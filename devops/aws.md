## Overview

AWS has both *IaaS* and *PaaS* offerings. The former allow you utilize AWS for IT infrastucture needs without having to maintaina a physical datacenter, While the latter take it a step further and remove the burden of performing adminstrative tasks on individual services.

AWS services can fall under four broad categories:

- Networking 
- Compute
- Storage
- Databases

AWS global infrastructure is divided into regions and availability zones. A `region` is a distinct geographical area which is made up of `availability zones(AZs)`. An `AZ` is datacenter or group of datacenters that operate independently with their own infrastructure like power and networking. A fault in one `AZ` will not affect operations in another.

Identity and Access Management allows AWS accounts to configure users and the AWS resources they have access to. IAM defines three(3) identities: 

- User: A person or application with keys and secrets assigned to them.
- Group: A collection of users that share a set of permissions. 
- Role: A role has specific permissions that can be assumed by users or groups.
