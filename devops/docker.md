## Basics

A _Docker container_ is a lightweight, standalone, executable piece of software runs inside a _Docker host_. It is isolated from other containers and from host itself, unless configured otherwise. A container has everything it needs to run: OS, runtime, packages, standard I/O, files, etc.

Containers are created from _images_. A Docker image is a template that describes everything needed to create and run a Docker container. Images are stored in _registries_.

Volumes: share data between host and container
