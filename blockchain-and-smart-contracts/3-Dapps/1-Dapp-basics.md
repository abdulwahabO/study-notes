## Decentralized Apps (Dapps)

`Dapps` allow people and systems not known to each other to transact peer-to-peer. Dapps are the outside world's gateway to a blockchain. A Dapp is an end-to-end on a blockchain.

A Dapp has a client interface as it's frontend, and a backend that _includes_ a blockchain and smart contracts. A Dapp communicates with the blockchain over JSON-RPC. 

## Ethereum APIs

An Ethereum node provides two categories of APIs that Dapps can call:

* Management APIs - `admin`, `debug`, `miner`, `personal`, `txpool`, e.t.c. These support methods for managing a node.
* Web3 APIs - `web3`, `eth`, `net`, e.t.c. This support methods for developing Dapps.

Dapps rely on client libraries written in different languages to make this calls.
