## Overview

Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform for the storage and processing of streams of events. An event can be thought of as a independent piece of information. E.g., a user click on a website, A transaction on Amazon etc. Kafka is primarily used for building data pipelines and streaming solutions.
Kafka uses cases include:

- Messaging between different components.
- Metrics and logging.
- Stream processing.

Kafka is built aroun the concept of a _commit log_(also known as write-ahead log). A commit log is a sequence of records where each record has a unique identifier. It is immutable and records can only be added at the end. Commit logs are used extensively in software development. They serve as a reliable record of what has happened in a system and in what order. Databases and caches use commit logs to reconstruct the state of the system after a crash.
