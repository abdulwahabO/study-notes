## Algorithms

_Asymptotic analysis_ is used to evaluate how much more time/space an algorithm will need as its input size grows. This analysis is independent of the programming language used, the CPU power, and other hardware factors.

Big-O denotes the maximum time an algorithm will take to run, or its worst-case time complexity.
